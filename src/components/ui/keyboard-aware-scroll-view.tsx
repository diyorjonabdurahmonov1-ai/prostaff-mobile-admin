/**
 * A ScrollView that keeps the focused field above the keyboard.
 *
 * Drop-in replacement for `ScrollView` on any screen with a form. It wires the
 * measurement in `useKeyboardAwareScroll` and publishes the reveal callback so
 * an input can ask to be scrolled into view when focus moves between fields
 * with the keyboard already up.
 *
 * `keyboardShouldPersistTaps="handled"` is the default here on purpose: without
 * it, the first tap on a button while an input is focused is swallowed by the
 * keyboard dismissal and the user has to tap twice.
