/**
 * Keeps the focused text input above the keyboard.
 *
 * `KeyboardAvoidingView` alone is not enough: it shrinks the container so the
 * content *can* fit, but it never scrolls, so a field halfway down a long form
 * stays exactly where it was — behind the keyboard. React Native's ScrollView
 * used to auto-scroll to the focused input and no longer does, so the scroll is
 * ours to do.
 *
 * Two things have to trigger it, and only together do they cover a real form:
 *
 *  1. The keyboard opening — handled by the `Keyboard` listener here.
 *  2. Moving from one field to the next while the keyboard is *already* open —
 *     no keyboard event fires for that, so each input calls `scrollToFocused`
 *     from its `onFocus`, reached through `KeyboardAwareScrollContext`.
 *
 * Measurement is done in window coordinates against the keyboard's own
 * `screenY`, which keeps it correct no matter what headers, footers or insets
 * sit around the scroll view.
